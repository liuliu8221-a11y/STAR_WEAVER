# Star Weaver
## Short Description 
*Users can record their voices on the website and create their own star. All recordings will remain on the site, and anyone can click on another user's star to listen to their voice.*

## Concept
*Urban development has diminished human interaction, making loneliness an inescapable sensation. Through this website that preserves voices, we hope to create a space where people in our communication-starved modern society can connect through simple syllables or words—a convergence of sound. Let the vibrant clamor wash away the icy chill of solitude.* 

## Technology Used 
*Use p5.js for basic coding.
The code for freely adjusting the number and size of star points draws upon Gianlucamonaco's p5.js implementation. We have modified the mouse movement control to keyboard key adjustments for drawing, making it more convenient for users to perform simple webpage operations.

The code for sound recording, playback, and saving was developed by referencing the official sample code from the p5 Web Editor.

Collaborate via GitHub and ultimately generate web links using Render.* 
## How to Run
* Upon entering the webpage, users will immediately observe stars traversing their respective orbits. Clicking on a star plays voice messages left by other users.
Pressing the “create” button at the bottom of the screen allows you to create your own star. Here, you may select the star's shape and size by sliding the control bar. Clicking the “hola” button cycles through different halo patterns. The naming bar at the top permits you to add your own star name.
Finally, pressing the spacebar initiates the recording phase, which automatically concludes after three seconds.
The star will then join the orbit, circulating alongside the other celestial bodies. *
